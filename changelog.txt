    Fluke45 Changelog
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


21/11/24 - v1.0 a10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed problem with updated OS returning large list of mostly invalid ports,
which would raise errors when checked for a meter. Now looks for a valid hwid
before attempting those checks, skipping if invalid.

Also, previously changed the method of checking for a Fluke45 with find_ports(),
using new function isF45(). This was to counter problems when an N56FU was also
connected.  The new function is similar to get_prompt(), which was previously used,
but with slightly different logic.

Updated README to give info about setting the meter's state in lieu of a dedicated
method.


09/06/24 - v1.0 a8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At an operational state comparable with N56FU.py
Still alpha, as a setting method is still to come.
